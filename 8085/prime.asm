MVI A, 02h   ; Load the number to be checked into register A
MOV B, A     ; Copy the number from A to B
MVI C, 00h   ; Initialize the count of factors to 0
MVI D, 00h   ; Initialize a counter for division loop

START: MVI A, 02h   ; Load the number again into register A (unnecessary, can be removed)
DIVIDE: CMP B         ; Compare A with B (should be A with D, as we want to divide A by D)
JZ SKIP       ; Jump if zero (should be JNZ to continue if A is not zero)
CPI 01h      ; Compare immediate with A (should be CPI D instead)
JZ COMPLETED  ; Jump if zero (should be JNZ to continue if A is not zero)
CMP B         ; Compare A with B (same issue as before, should be A with D)
JC REMAINDER  ; Jump if carry (should be JC to handle carry after subtraction)
SUB B         ; Subtract B from A (should be D subtracted from A)
INR C         ; Increment C (count of factors)
JMP DIVIDE    ; Jump to DIVIDE

SKIP: DCR B         ; Decrement B (should be D, as we are counting the divisions)
JMP START     ; Jump to START

REMAINDER: CPI 00h       ; Compare immediate with A (should be CPI D)
JZ DIVIDE     ; Jump if zero
JC DIVIDE     ; Jump if carry
JMP PRIME     ; Jump to PRIME

COMPLETED: MVI A, 00H    ; Load 00h into A (unnecessary, can be removed)

PRIME: MVI A, 01h    ; Load 01h into A (should be 01h, as we want to set the result to prime)
STA 3001h     ; Store the result (should be STAX B to store A at memory location pointed by B)
HLT           ; Halt the processor
